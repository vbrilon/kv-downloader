# Configuration Notes:
# - URLs should be direct links to individual song pages on Karaoke-Version.com
# - Name is optional - uses smart auto-extraction from URL if omitted:
#   * No conflicts: folder named with song only (e.g., "Paranoid")
#   * With conflicts: folder named "Artist - Song" to prevent overwrites
#   * System automatically detects duplicate song names across all configured songs
# - Description is optional and used for documentation only
# - Key supports multiple formats:
#   * Integer: 2, -3, 0
#   * String with sign: "+2", "-3", "+0"  
#   * String without sign: "2", "5" (treated as positive)
#   * Range: -12 to +12 semitones (values outside range default to 0)
# - Add as many songs as needed following the same format
