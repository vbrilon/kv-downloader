# Project Work Plan

## Current Status: âœ… PRODUCTION READY + PERFORMANCE BASELINE ESTABLISHED

System is production-ready with comprehensive test coverage and performance baseline established via Playwright MCP profiling.

## Recently Completed Work (2025-08-05)

### âœ… Performance Analysis & Optimization Planning (Latest)
1. **âœ… Performance Profiling** - Comprehensive Playwright MCP analysis of karaoke-version.com
2. **âœ… Baseline Documentation** - Created PERF.md with real-world timing data
3. **âœ… Optimization Roadmap** - Data-driven performance improvement plan with measurable targets

### âœ… Cross-Browser Mode Compatibility & Testing (Completed)
1. **âœ… Production Reliability** - Fixed headless mode timeout and infinite processing issues
2. **âœ… Test Coverage** - 117+ unit tests across all architectural components
3. **âœ… Regression Prevention** - Automated validation preventing critical bugs


## Current Priority: Performance Optimization Implementation

**Target**: 12-17% overall workflow acceleration (102s â†’ 85-90s) based on PERF.md analysis.

### ðŸ”„ Active Tasks

**High Impact, Low Risk (Immediate):**
- [ ] **Configuration Tuning**: Update config.py constants based on real-world timing data
  - SOLO_ACTIVATION_DELAY: 5s â†’ 12s  
  - DOWNLOAD_CHECK_INTERVAL: 2s â†’ 5s
  - DOWNLOAD_MAX_WAIT: 300s â†’ 90s
- [ ] **Track Complexity Detection**: Implement adaptive timeouts (15s for 8-track, 21s for 12+ track mixers)
- [ ] **Download Monitoring Optimization**: Add 30s initial wait before monitoring

### ðŸ“‹ Planned Tasks

**Medium Impact, Medium Risk:**
- [ ] **Solo Button Flow Streamlining**: Merge Phase 1-2 verification in track_manager.py:277-323
- [ ] **Adaptive Polling**: Replace fixed delays with event-driven detection

**High Impact, High Risk (Future):**
- [ ] **Event-Driven Detection System**: DOM mutation observer implementation
- [ ] **Pre-Generation Strategy**: Cache popular track combinations

### ðŸ“Š Performance Targets
- **Current Baseline**: 18.1s track isolation, 102s total workflow
- **Phase 1 Target**: 15-20% track isolation improvement
- **Final Target**: 85-90s total workflow (12-17% overall improvement)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Production monitoring system
- **Batch Processing**: Multi-song parallel processing  
- **Enhanced Retry Logic**: Sophisticated retry mechanisms
- **Additional Test Coverage**: Track management, config edge cases, file operations caching

## Quick Commands
- **Environment**: `source bin/activate`
- **Testing**: `python tests/run_tests.py --regression-only`
- **Debug Mode**: `python karaoke_automator.py --debug`
- **Performance Data**: See `docs/PERF.md`
