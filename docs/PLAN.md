# Project Work Plan

## Current Status: ⚠️ CRITICAL PERFORMANCE REGRESSION

## Recently Completed (2025-08-05)
- ✅ Performance optimizations implemented (adaptive timeouts, download monitoring)
- ✅ Track complexity detection (15s simple, 21s complex arrangements)  
- ✅ Configuration tuning (various timeout adjustments)

**⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE**: Downloads now taking ~2x longer after recent performance optimizations.

## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN - Performance Profiling & Regression Fix

### Phase 1: Profiling Infrastructure (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### 1.1 Runtime Profiling Implementation
- [ ] **Create --profile flag for karaoke_automator.py**
  - Command: `python karaoke_automator.py --profile` 
  - Generates performance logs in `logs/performance/` directory
  - Enables comprehensive timing collection across all components
  - **Deliverable**: Performance logs ready for bottleneck analysis

#### 1.2 PerformanceProfiler Infrastructure
- [ ] **Implement core PerformanceProfiler class**
  - Multi-tier profiling: System → Component → Method → Operation level
  - Timing decorators: `@profile_timing()`, `@profile_selenium()`, `@profile_method()`
  - Memory & resource utilization tracking
  - Context-aware logging (song complexity, browser mode, network conditions)

#### 1.3 Critical Path Instrumentation
- [ ] **Track Management System Profiling** (PRIMARY SUSPECT)
  - `@profile_timing("track.solo_activation")` - 5s → 12s/15s/21s impact analysis
  - `@profile_timing("track.complexity_detection")` - Simple vs complex categorization
  - `@profile_timing("track.audio_validation")` - Two-phase validation timing
  
- [ ] **Download Management System Profiling** (CRITICAL PATH)
  - `@profile_timing("download.monitoring")` - 30s initial wait impact analysis
  - `@profile_timing("download.execution")` - Polling efficiency (2s vs 5s intervals)
  - `@profile_timing("download.completion_detection")` - Cross-mode timing differential

### Phase 2: Regression Root Cause Analysis

#### 2.1 A/B Configuration Testing
- [ ] **Baseline Establishment**
  - Current config vs pre-optimization config end-to-end timing
  - Individual optimization impact isolation:
    - SOLO_ACTIVATION_DELAY: 5s vs 12s vs 15s vs 21s
    - DOWNLOAD_MONITORING_INITIAL_WAIT: 0s vs 30s
    - DOWNLOAD_CHECK_INTERVAL: 2s vs 5s

#### 2.2 Bottleneck Isolation Protocol  
- [ ] **Top-Down Performance Analysis**
  1. End-to-end song processing timing measurement
  2. Component-level timing breakdown identification  
  3. Method-level micro-profiling within bottleneck component
  4. Operation-level timing analysis for specific bottleneck method

#### 2.3 Complexity-Based Performance Testing
- [ ] **Performance Matrix Testing**
  - Simple arrangements (≤8 tracks): Baseline timing expectations
  - Complex arrangements (9+ tracks): Adaptive timeout validation
  - Edge cases: Maximum track count (15 tracks) stress testing
  - Browser mode differential: Headless vs visible timing variance

### Phase 3: Data-Driven Optimization

#### 3.1 Performance Report Generation
- [ ] **Automated Performance Analysis**
  - Hierarchical timing breakdown by component/method
  - Bottleneck identification with performance impact quantification
  - Regression analysis: Before/after optimization comparison
  - Success rate correlation with performance metrics

#### 3.2 Targeted Optimization Implementation
- [ ] **Primary Hypothesis Testing**: Solo activation delay cascade impact
- [ ] **Secondary Hypothesis Testing**: 30s download monitoring wait necessity  
- [ ] **Tertiary Hypothesis Testing**: Complexity detection accuracy validation

### Phase 4: Performance Monitoring & Validation

#### 4.1 Regression Prevention
- [ ] **Performance Test Integration**
  - Add performance benchmarks to `tests/run_tests.py --regression-only`
  - Continuous performance monitoring with acceptable threshold alerts
  - Performance baseline updates after validated optimizations

## Performance Profiling Strategy Details

### Multi-Tier Profiling Architecture

**Tier 1: System-Level** (End-to-End Pipeline)
- Full song processing: authentication → download completion
- Resource utilization: CPU, memory, network tracking
- Browser process overhead measurement

**Tier 2: Component-Level** (Package-Level)  
- Individual package execution timing via dependency injection instrumentation
- Inter-component communication overhead analysis
- Component initialization/teardown cost measurement

**Tier 3: Method-Level** (Critical Path Functions)
- Function-by-function timing within bottleneck components
- Selenium operation granular timing with error correlation
- File I/O operation profiling with cache impact analysis

**Tier 4: Operation-Level** (Micro-benchmarking)
- Individual DOM interaction timing
- Network request latency measurement  
- File system call profiling with optimization opportunities

### Expected Performance Testing Outcomes

**Primary Investigation Targets:**
1. **Solo Activation Impact**: Quantify 5s → 12s+ delay actual performance cost
2. **Download Monitoring Overhead**: Measure 30s initial wait necessity vs efficiency
3. **Complexity Detection Accuracy**: Validate adaptive timeout logic against song arrangements
4. **Polling Optimization**: Determine optimal check frequencies based on completion patterns

**Success Criteria:**
- Identify exact source of 2x performance regression  
- Provide data-driven optimization recommendations
- Restore or improve upon pre-optimization performance levels
- Maintain system stability and success rates

## Lower Priority Tasks (Post-Regression Fix)

### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] **Console UI Status Accuracy**: Fix progress tracking (downloading vs processing states)
- [ ] **Solo Button Flow Streamlining**: Merge Phase 1-2 verification

### Advanced Optimizations (Future)
- [ ] **Event-Driven Detection System**: DOM mutation observer implementation  
- [ ] **Pre-Generation Strategy**: Cache popular track combinations
- [ ] **Adaptive Polling**: Replace fixed delays with event-driven detection

## Development Notes
- **Environment**: `source bin/activate` (required)
- **Testing**: `python tests/run_tests.py --regression-only`
- **Debug Mode**: `python karaoke_automator.py --debug`
- **NEW - Profile Mode**: `python karaoke_automator.py --profile` (generates logs/performance/)
