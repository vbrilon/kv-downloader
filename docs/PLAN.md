# Project Work Plan

## Current Status: âœ… PRODUCTION READY - ALL TASKS COMPLETE

The system is fully functional with all planned refactoring and cleanup tasks completed successfully.

## Completed Work (2025-08-04)

### âœ… Major Refactoring Tasks (Completed)
1. **Remove Dead Configuration** - Cleaned unused constants from config.py
2. **Extract Common Validation Logic** - Simplified validation system (removed 800+ lines)
3. **Break Down God Method** - Refactored download_current_mix into focused methods
4. **Standardize Error Handling** - Implemented decorator-based error handling system
5. **Simplify Over-Engineered Validation** - Replaced complex 3-phase system with simple 2-method approach
6. **Remove Tight Coupling** - Implemented dependency injection with constructor injection pattern
7. **File Processing Sequence Fix** - Fixed file validation using renamed paths instead of original paths
8. **Clean Up Unused Imports** - Removed dead imports (threading, json, Union, Dict)
9. **Extract Magic Numbers** - Created 30+ named constants for timeouts, delays, and thresholds

### Impact Achieved
- **Code Reduction**: ~800+ lines removed
- **Architecture**: Dependency injection eliminates tight coupling
- **Configuration**: Centralized constants for maintainability
- **Reliability**: Proper error handling and file processing pipeline

## Next Priority Tasks

### ðŸŸ¢ Optional Enhancements (No immediate priority)
1. **Optimize File Operations** - Reduce repeated file system calls
2. **Investigate Speed Improvements** - Profile and optimize remaining performance bottlenecks

### Future Enhancement Opportunities (Optional)
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Production monitoring system
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple songs simultaneously
- **Enhanced Retry Logic**: More sophisticated retry mechanisms
- **Code Coverage**: Expand test coverage beyond regression tests

## Development Notes

- **Environment**: Always run `source bin/activate` before Python operations
- **Testing**: Use `python tests/run_tests.py --regression-only` to verify system state
- **Debug Mode**: Use `python karaoke_automator.py --debug` for troubleshooting
- **Configuration**: All timeouts and constants are centralized in `packages/configuration/config.py`
