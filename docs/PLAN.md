# Project Work Plan

## Current Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PERFORMANCE REGRESSION

## Recently Completed (2025-08-05)
- ‚úÖ Performance optimizations implemented (adaptive timeouts, download monitoring)
- ‚úÖ Track complexity detection (15s simple, 21s complex arrangements)  
- ‚úÖ Configuration tuning (various timeout adjustments)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUE**: Downloads now taking ~2x longer after recent performance optimizations.

## URGENT Priority Tasks

### üö® Performance Regression Investigation
- [ ] **Investigate 2x Download Slowdown** 
  - Analyze increased SOLO_ACTIVATION_DELAY impact (5s ‚Üí 12s, 15s, 21s)
  - Review 30s initial wait in download monitoring causing delays
  - Test adaptive timeout logic correctness
  - Identify specific optimization causing slowdown
  - **BLOCKING**: Fix before any further optimization work

### üîß System Performance Instrumentation  
- [ ] **Add comprehensive timing instrumentation**
  - Timing decorators for all major methods (track discovery, solo ops, downloads)
  - Performance logging with method-level timing data
  - Memory usage tracking for resource optimization
  - Generate detailed performance reports by system component
  - **Goal**: Identify actual production bottlenecks for targeted optimization

## Lower Priority Tasks

### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] **Console UI Status Accuracy**: Fix progress tracking (downloading vs processing states)
- [ ] **Solo Button Flow Streamlining**: Merge Phase 1-2 verification

### Advanced Optimizations (Future)
- [ ] **Event-Driven Detection System**: DOM mutation observer implementation  
- [ ] **Pre-Generation Strategy**: Cache popular track combinations
- [ ] **Adaptive Polling**: Replace fixed delays with event-driven detection

## Development Notes
- **Environment**: `source bin/activate` (required)
- **Testing**: `python tests/run_tests.py --regression-only`
- **Debug Mode**: `python karaoke_automator.py --debug`
