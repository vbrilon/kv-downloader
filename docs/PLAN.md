# Project Work Plan

## Current Status: ✅ PRODUCTION READY

All critical functionality is complete and working. The system successfully downloads isolated backing tracks with comprehensive validation.

## Recent Completed Work

### ✅ Critical Bug Fix (2025-08-04)
- **Issue**: `NameError: name 'track_index' is not defined` causing 100% track isolation failures
- **Root Cause**: Missing parameter in `packages/track_management/track_manager.py:_activate_solo_button()` method chain  
- **Resolution**: Updated method signature to properly pass `track_index` parameter
- **Verification**: Debug run confirmed tracks now progress from "Isolating" → "Processing" → Download monitoring
- **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Track isolation now working correctly

### ✅ Solo Button Enhancement System (Completed Earlier)
- **Phase 1**: Enhanced solo verification with 100% pass rate requirement
- **Phase 2**: Improved timing & synchronization with 5s delays  
- **Phase 3**: Multi-layer audio validation (mixer + server + fingerprinting)
- **Phase 4**: Persistent state verification before downloads
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - All phases implemented and tested

## No Active Todos

The system is feature-complete and production-ready. No critical or high-priority work items remain.

## Future Enhancement Opportunities (Optional)

These are not required for functionality but could be considered for future development:

### Low Priority Enhancements
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Comprehensive monitoring system for production deployments
- **Retry Logic**: Enhanced retry mechanisms for network/site issues  
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple songs simultaneously
- **UI Improvements**: Enhanced progress reporting and user interface

### Technical Debt (Minor)
- **Code Coverage**: Expand test coverage beyond current regression tests
- **Documentation**: Additional API documentation for package modules
- **Configuration**: More granular configuration options

## Notes for Future Sessions

1. **Environment Setup**: Always run `source bin/activate` before any Python operations
2. **Testing**: Run `python tests/run_tests.py --regression-only` to verify system state
3. **Debug Mode**: Use `python karaoke_automator.py --debug` for troubleshooting
4. **Architecture**: See CLAUDE.md for technical implementation details
