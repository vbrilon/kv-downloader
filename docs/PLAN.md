# Project Work Plan

## Current Status: ‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY + PERFORMANCE BASELINE ESTABLISHED

System is production-ready with comprehensive test coverage and performance baseline established via Playwright MCP profiling.

## Recently Completed Work (2025-08-05)

### ‚úÖ Performance Optimization Implementation (Latest)
1. **‚úÖ Configuration Tuning** - Updated config.py constants based on real-world timing data
   - SOLO_ACTIVATION_DELAY: 5s ‚Üí 12s, DOWNLOAD_CHECK_INTERVAL: 2s ‚Üí 5s, DOWNLOAD_MAX_WAIT: 300s ‚Üí 90s
2. **‚úÖ Track Complexity Detection** - Implemented adaptive timeouts (15s for 8-track, 21s for 12+ track mixers)
3. **‚úÖ Download Monitoring Optimization** - Added 30s initial wait before monitoring based on server generation analysis

### ‚úÖ Performance Analysis & Optimization Planning (Completed)
1. **‚úÖ Performance Profiling** - Comprehensive Playwright MCP analysis of karaoke-version.com
2. **‚úÖ Baseline Documentation** - Created PERF.md with real-world timing data
3. **‚úÖ Optimization Roadmap** - Data-driven performance improvement plan with measurable targets

### ‚úÖ Cross-Browser Mode Compatibility & Testing (Completed)
1. **‚úÖ Production Reliability** - Fixed headless mode timeout and infinite processing issues
2. **‚úÖ Test Coverage** - 117+ unit tests across all architectural components
3. **‚úÖ Regression Prevention** - Automated validation preventing critical bugs

**Performance Impact**: Implemented optimizations target 12-17% overall workflow acceleration (102s ‚Üí 85-90s) through adaptive timeouts, optimized polling intervals, and elimination of unnecessary monitoring delays.

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PERFORMANCE REGRESSION**: After implementing the performance optimizations, downloads are now taking approximately **twice as long** as before. This suggests the optimizations may have introduced unintended side effects or the timing assumptions were incorrect. **Immediate investigation and fix required.**

## Current Priority: Performance Regression Investigation & System Instrumentation

### üîÑ Active Tasks

**URGENT - Performance Regression Investigation:**
- [ ] **Investigate 2x Download Slowdown**: Critical regression after performance optimizations
  - Analyze impact of increased SOLO_ACTIVATION_DELAY (5s ‚Üí 12s, 15s, 21s)
  - Review 30s initial wait in download monitoring - may be causing delays
  - Check if adaptive timeouts are being applied incorrectly
  - Compare actual vs expected timing in track isolation phase
  - Identify which specific optimization is causing the slowdown
  - **Priority**: Fix regression before further optimization work

**High Priority - Performance Instrumentation:**
- [ ] **System Performance Instrumentation**: Instrument the entire system for performance monitoring
  - Add timing decorators to all major methods (track discovery, solo operations, download processes)
  - Implement performance logging with method-level timing data
  - Create performance metrics collection for bottleneck identification
  - Add memory usage tracking for resource optimization opportunities
  - Generate detailed performance reports showing time spent in each system component
  - **Goal**: Identify actual biggest bottlenecks in real production usage for targeted optimization

### üìã Planned Tasks (Lower Priority)

**Medium Impact, Medium Risk:**
- [ ] **Console UI Status Accuracy**: Fix progress tracking to accurately reflect download states
  - Currently jumps from "downloading" to "processing" immediately when download starts
  - Should show "Downloading" during file download, "Processing" during rename/cleanup
  - Improve user experience with accurate real-time status updates
- [ ] **Solo Button Flow Streamlining**: Merge Phase 1-2 verification in track_manager.py:277-323
- [ ] **Adaptive Polling**: Replace fixed delays with event-driven detection

**High Impact, High Risk (Future Research):**
- [ ] **Event-Driven Detection System**: DOM mutation observer implementation
- [ ] **Pre-Generation Strategy**: Cache popular track combinations

### üìä Performance Status
- **Initial Baseline**: 18.1s track isolation, 102s total workflow
- **Phase 1 Optimizations**: ‚úÖ Completed (Adaptive timeouts, optimized polling, monitoring delays)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è REGRESSION DETECTED**: Downloads now taking ~2x longer than baseline (URGENT FIX NEEDED)
- **Root Cause Analysis Required**: Investigate which optimization caused the slowdown
- **Target Achievement**: 85-90s total workflow (12-17% overall improvement) - **BLOCKED by regression**

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Production monitoring system
- **Batch Processing**: Multi-song parallel processing  
- **Enhanced Retry Logic**: Sophisticated retry mechanisms
- **Additional Test Coverage**: Track management, config edge cases, file operations caching

## Quick Commands
- **Environment**: `source bin/activate`
- **Testing**: `python tests/run_tests.py --regression-only`
- **Debug Mode**: `python karaoke_automator.py --debug`
- **Performance Data**: See `docs/PERF.md`
