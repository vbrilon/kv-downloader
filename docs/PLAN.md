# Project Work Plan

## Current Status: âœ… PRODUCTION READY - ALL REFACTORING COMPLETE

The system is fully functional with significant architectural improvements completed. All medium-priority refactoring tasks have been successfully implemented.

## Completed Work (2025-08-04)

### âœ… Priority Refactoring Tasks Completed
1. **Remove Dead Configuration** - Cleaned unused constants from config.py
2. **Extract Common Validation Logic** - Simplified validation system (removed 800+ lines)
3. **Break Down God Method** - Refactored download_current_mix into focused methods
4. **âœ… Standardize Error Handling** - Implemented decorator-based error handling system
5. **âœ… Simplify Over-Engineered Validation** - Replaced complex 3-phase system with simple 2-method approach
6. **âœ… Remove Tight Coupling** - Implemented dependency injection with constructor injection pattern

### âœ… Critical Bug Fixes
7. **âœ… File Processing Sequence Fix** - Fixed file validation using renamed paths instead of original paths
   - **Issue**: Files renamed during cleanup, but validation still tried to check original (non-existent) filenames
   - **Solution**: Updated `_clean_downloaded_files()` to return path mapping, validation now uses correct renamed paths
   - **Result**: Downloads complete successfully with proper file validation

### Impact Achieved
- **Code Reduction**: ~800+ lines removed (validation complexity + error handling patterns)
- **Architecture**: Dependency injection eliminates tight coupling between managers
- **Functionality**: File processing pipeline now works correctly without validation errors
- **Reliability**: Fewer moving parts, predictable behavior, proper error handling

## Next Priority Tasks

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority (Optional Enhancement)
7. **Clean Up Unused Imports** - Remove dead imports across modules
8. **Extract Magic Numbers** - Replace hard-coded timeouts with constants  
9. **Optimize File Operations** - Reduce repeated file system calls
10. **Investigate Hardcoded Timeouts** - Audit sleep() calls and hardcoded delays across the codebase for potential speed improvements and optimization opportunities

### Future Enhancement Opportunities (Optional)
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Production monitoring system
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple songs simultaneously
- **Enhanced Retry Logic**: More sophisticated retry mechanisms
- **Code Coverage**: Expand test coverage beyond regression tests

## Notes for Future Sessions

1. **Environment Setup**: Always run `source bin/activate` before Python operations
2. **Testing**: Run `python tests/run_tests.py --regression-only` to verify system state
3. **Debug Mode**: Use `python karaoke_automator.py --debug` for troubleshooting
4. **Architecture Details**: See CLAUDE.md for technical implementation and system architecture
5. **Dependency Injection**: Use `packages/di/` for service management and dependency resolution

## Known Issues
- None currently identified - system functioning correctly
