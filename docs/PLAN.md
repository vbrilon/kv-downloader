# Project Work Plan

## Current Status: âœ… PRODUCTION READY

All critical functionality is complete and working. The system successfully downloads isolated backing tracks with comprehensive validation.

## Recent Completed Work (2025-08-04)

### âœ… High Priority Refactoring Tasks Completed
1. **Remove Dead Configuration** - Cleaned 17 lines of unused constants from `config.py`
2. **Extract Common Validation Logic** - Created unified `packages/validation/` module, consolidated ~300 lines
3. **Break Down God Method** - Refactored 127-line `download_current_mix` into 56-line orchestration + 4 focused methods

### âœ… Earlier System Fixes  
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Fixed `NameError: name 'track_index'` causing 100% track isolation failures
- **Solo Button Enhancement**: 4-phase validation system with comprehensive audio state verification

## Next Priority Tasks

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority (Ready for Implementation)
4. **Standardize Error Handling** - Create decorator for 15+ repeated try-catch patterns
5. **Simplify Over-Engineered Validation** - Remove complex 3-phase system (200+ lines)
6. **Remove Tight Coupling** - Implement dependency injection for managers

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority (Future Enhancement)
7. **Clean Up Unused Imports** - Remove dead imports across modules
8. **Extract Magic Numbers** - Replace hard-coded timeouts with constants
9. **Optimize File Operations** - Reduce repeated file system calls

### Estimated Impact of Remaining Tasks
- **Additional Code Reduction**: 10-15% from remaining medium priority tasks
- **Performance**: 15-25% fewer DOM queries, 10% faster file operations
- **Maintainability**: Consistent error handling, reduced coupling between components

## Current Active Status

The system is feature-complete and production-ready. All high-priority refactoring tasks have been completed successfully. Medium-priority optimization tasks remain for future enhancement.

## Future Enhancement Opportunities (Optional)

These are not required for functionality but could be considered for future development:

### Low Priority Enhancements
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Comprehensive monitoring system for production deployments
- **Retry Logic**: Enhanced retry mechanisms for network/site issues  
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple songs simultaneously
- **UI Improvements**: Enhanced progress reporting and user interface

### Technical Debt (Minor)
- **Code Coverage**: Expand test coverage beyond current regression tests
- **Documentation**: Additional API documentation for package modules
- **Configuration**: More granular configuration options

## Notes for Future Sessions

1. **Environment Setup**: Always run `source bin/activate` before any Python operations
2. **Testing**: Run `python tests/run_tests.py --regression-only` to verify system state
3. **Debug Mode**: Use `python karaoke_automator.py --debug` for troubleshooting
4. **Architecture**: See CLAUDE.md for technical implementation details
5. **Validation**: Use `packages/validation/` module for any validation-related changes
