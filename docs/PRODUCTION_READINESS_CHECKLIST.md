#### **Resource Cleanup Vulnerability**
**Issue**: Browser resources may not be cleaned up in all error scenarios

- [ ] **Main entry point protection**
  - [ ] Wrap `karaoke_automator.py` main execution in try/except/finally
  - [ ] Ensure `driver.quit()` called in all exception paths
  - [ ] Add proper logging for cleanup operations
  - [ ] Test cleanup under various failure scenarios

- [ ] **Component-level cleanup**
  - [ ] Verify ChromeManager.quit() is called in all code paths
  - [ ] Add context manager support for browser lifecycle
  - [ ] Implement graceful shutdown signal handling
  - [ ] Add cleanup for temporary files and session data

---

## üîß **Quality Improvements (Recommended)**

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY - Should Complete Soon**

#### **Code Complexity Reduction**
- [ ] **Refactor large methods in file_manager.py**
  - [ ] Extract helpers from `clean_filename_for_download()` (60 lines ‚Üí target <30)
  - [ ] Extract helpers from `cleanup_existing_downloads()` (55 lines ‚Üí target <30)
  - [ ] Follow successful pattern from `download_current_mix()` refactoring
  - [ ] Maintain public API compatibility
  - [ ] Add unit tests for extracted methods

#### **Code Cleanliness**
- [ ] **Remove unused imports**
  - [ ] Remove `import json` from `packages/authentication/login_manager.py:5`
  - [ ] Remove `from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC` from `karaoke_automator.py:14`
  - [ ] Remove `StaleElementReferenceException` from unused exception imports

- [ ] **Remove unused constants**
  - [ ] Remove `COMMON_TRACK_TYPES` array from `packages/configuration/config.py:23-35`
  - [ ] Clean up related exports in package `__init__.py` files

## ‚ö° **Future Enhancements (Optional)**

### **LOW PRIORITY - Nice to Have**

#### **Performance Monitoring**
- [ ] Add timing metrics for each operation type
- [ ] Implement performance dashboard/logging
- [ ] Add memory usage monitoring
- [ ] Create performance baseline measurements

#### **Architecture Enhancements**
- [ ] Implement async file operations for large downloads
- [ ] Add cancellation support for long-running operations
- [ ] Consider concurrent song processing capabilities
- [ ] Add health check endpoints for production monitoring

#### **Production Hardening**
- [ ] Add configuration validation with JSON schema
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- [ ] Add circuit breaker pattern for external service calls
- [ ] Create deployment scripts and production configuration

## üìä **Verification Tests**

### **Performance Validation**
- [ ] **Measure baseline performance** before fixes
  - [ ] Time complete song processing (login ‚Üí download ‚Üí cleanup)
  - [ ] Monitor memory usage during operation
  - [ ] Record blocking time per operation type

- [ ] **Validate performance improvements** after fixes
  - [ ] Confirm 4-6x speed improvement in blocking operations
  - [ ] Verify memory usage remains stable
  - [ ] Test with multiple songs to ensure consistent performance

### **Reliability Testing**
- [ ] **Resource cleanup validation**
  - [ ] Test graceful shutdown under normal conditions
  - [ ] Test cleanup when automation fails mid-process
  - [ ] Test cleanup when browser crashes or becomes unresponsive
  - [ ] Verify no orphaned Chrome processes after cleanup

- [ ] **Exception handling validation**
  - [ ] Test network failures during operation
  - [ ] Test invalid credentials scenarios
  - [ ] Test file system permission errors
  - [ ] Verify all exceptions are properly logged and handled

### **Regression Testing**
- [ ] **Run full test suite** after all fixes
  - [ ] Execute regression tests: `python tests/run_tests.py --regression-only`
  - [ ] Execute unit tests: `python tests/run_tests.py --unit-only`
  - [ ] Execute integration tests: `python tests/run_tests.py --integration-only`
  - [ ] Verify all tests maintain 100% pass rate

- [ ] **End-to-end validation**
  - [ ] Test complete workflow with real credentials (in test environment)
  - [ ] Verify session persistence functionality
  - [ ] Test progress tracking and statistics generation
  - [ ] Confirm file organization and cleanup

- [ ] **Login completion**: <10 seconds (currently ~14 seconds)
- [ ] **Track discovery**: <5 seconds per song
- [ ] **Download operations**: Limited only by network speed, not artificial delays

### **Reliability Targets**
- [ ] **Resource cleanup**: 100% success rate under all failure conditions
