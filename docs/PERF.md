## Executive Summary

Performance profiling of karaoke-version.com reveals a well-optimized track customization and download system with predictable timing patterns and efficient server-side processing. The site demonstrates consistent performance across different songs and instrument configurations, with download generation times averaging 60 seconds.

## Methodology

Using Playwright MCP for browser automation, we conducted real-time performance measurements of the complete track download workflow:

1. **Authentication**: Already logged in as "victorland" user
2. **Track Selection**: Tested 2 songs from songs.yaml configuration
3. **Mixer Interface**: Tested different track isolation scenarios
4. **Download Process**: Monitored server-side generation and file delivery
5. **Timing Collection**: JavaScript-based timestamp logging at each workflow step
